    <H2 id="configurator">Faderpunk Configurator</H2>
    <p>
      <strong>The Configurator is a core component of Faderpunk.</strong>
      <br />
      It's the tool you'll use to create app layouts, edit app parameters, and
      modify internal settings of the Faderpunk device.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Configurator uses <strong>WebUSB</strong>, a communication protocol
      that is not supported by all browsers. To access it, you'll need a{" "}
      <strong>Chromium-based browser</strong>.
    </p>

    <H3>Compatible Browsers with WebUSB Support:</H3>
    <List>
      <li>Google Chrome</li>
      <li>Microsoft Edge</li>
      <li>Vivaldi</li>
      <li>Brave</li>
      <li>Opera</li>
      <li>Chromium (open-source base)</li>
    </List>

    <p>
      To get started, open a WebUSB-compatible browser and visit{" "}
      <a className="font-semibold underline" href="https://faderpunk.io">
        https://faderpunk.io
      </a>
      .
      <br />
      Upon visiting the site, you'll be prompted to connect a device. Click{" "}
      <strong>"Connect Device"</strong>, and a pop-up will appear allowing you
      to select and connect to your Faderpunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once connected, you'll be greeted by the Configurator interface, which
      consists of <strong>three tabs</strong>:
    </p>
    <List>
      <li>
        <strong>Device Tab</strong> – Edit the layout and adjust parameters of
        the apps loaded in your configuration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Apps Tab</strong> – Choose which apps to include in your layout.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Settings Tab</strong> – Modify global configurations of the
        Faderpunk device.
      </li>
    </List>

    <H3>Device Tab</H3>

    <img
      className="my-6"
      alt="Screenshot of the device overview in the Faderpunk configurator"
      src="/img/configurator-device.png"
    />

    <p>The Device tab is divided into two sections:</p>

    <H4>Channel Overview</H4>
    <p>
      At the top, you'll find the <strong>Channel Overview</strong>, which
      provides a visual representation of the apps currently loaded on your
      Faderpunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clicking on this graphic opens the <strong>Edit Layout</strong> interface.
      Here, you can drag and drop apps to assign them to different channels.
      Clicking on an app within the layout editor allows you to{" "}
      <strong>remove</strong> it from the layout.
    </p>
    <p>
      To confirm your changes, click <strong>Save</strong>. This extra step
      helps prevent accidental modifications and loss of work.
      <br />
      Clicking <strong>Save</strong> will apply the new layout, while{" "}
      <strong>Cancel</strong> will discard the changes and return you to the
      main Device tab.
    </p>

    <H4>Active Apps</H4>
    <p>This section lets you edit the parameters of each loaded app.</p>
    <p>
      All apps currently installed on your Faderpunk are listed here in order.
      Each entry displays the app's name, its assigned channel, and the number
      of slots it occupies.
    </p>
    <p>
      To edit an app's parameters, simply click on it. A menu will appear below,
      allowing you to adjust its settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just like with the layout, you must click <strong>Save</strong> to apply
      changes to each individual app. This safeguard ensures that no unintended
      modifications are made.
    </p>

    <H3>Apps Tab</H3>

    <img
      className="my-6"
      alt="Screenshot of the apps tab in the Faderpunk configurator"
      src="/img/configurator-apps.png"
    />

    <p>
      The Apps tab is where you select the apps you'd like to include in your
      layout. Like the Device tab, it consists of two sections:
    </p>

    <H4>Channel Overview</H4>
    <p>
      This section is identical to the one in the Device tab. It provides a
      visual representation of your current layout and allows you to rearrange
      apps across channels.
    </p>

    <H4>Available Apps List</H4>
    <p>
      Apps are listed here in order of the number of channels they use, followed
      by alphabetical order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clicking on an app opens the <strong>Add App</strong> pop-up, where you
      can place the selected app into your layout. This pop-up also displays:
    </p>
    <List>
      <li>The app's available parameters</li>
      <li>The number of channels it occupies</li>
      <li>A link to the app's manual</li>
    </List>
    <p>
      Within the Add App interface, you can drag and drop not only the new app
      but also the apps already loaded on your Faderpunk. This allows for
      flexible layout adjustments.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there are no available channels for the selected app, you'll see the
      message:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        "I can't find space for the app. Try to remove apps or move them
        around."
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case, you can rearrange or delete apps just as you would in the
      Edit Layout pop-up.
    </p>

    <H3>Settings Tab</H3>

    <img
      className="my-6"
      alt="Screenshot of the settings tab in the Faderpunk configurator"
      src="/img/configurator-settings.png"
    />

    <p>
      In this tab, you can edit the <strong>global parameters</strong> of your
      Faderpunk device.
    </p>

    <H4>Clock Section</H4>
    <p>Here you can configure the clock behavior:</p>
    <List>
      <li>
        <strong>Clock Source</strong>: Choose between:
        <List>
          <li>Internal</li>

          <li>MIDI USB</li>
          <li>
            Analog AUX jacks (Atom, Meteor, Cube) on the right side of the
            device
          </li>
        </List>
      </li>
    </List>
    <p>
      ⚠️ Currently, the only supported analog clock input resolution is{" "}
