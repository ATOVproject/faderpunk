    <H3>Thank you for choosing Faderpunk!</H3>
    <p>
      We’re thrilled to have you on board. Faderpunk is the result of years of
      dedicated development, and it means a lot to us that it’s finally in your
      hands..
    </p>
    <H3>A Living Project</H3>
    <p>
      Faderpunk is designed to evolve. Updates are frequent, and it’s quite
      possible that by the time your unit reaches you, a newer firmware version
      is already available. The Configurator will automatically detect your
      device’s firmware and let you know if an update is needed.
    </p>
    <H3>What is Faderpunk?</H3>
    <p>
      Faderpunk is a 16-channel, fully configurable modulator/controller with a
      hands-on interface. It runs focused apps that use one or more channels to
      offer basic synthesiser CV functions such as LFOs, MIDI to CV, CV to MIDI,
      sequencers, envelopes, and more. Each app is intentionally kept simple and
      intuitive, avoiding menus. Complexity arises from creatively combining
      apps to build your own custom setups.
    </p>
    <H3>Your Custom Instrument</H3>
    <p>
      Using the online Configurator, you can design a layout—a collection of
      apps tailored to your needs. This layout transforms Faderpunk into your
      personal instrument, ready for performance. The Configurator is meant for
      setup only and isn’t part of the live workflow.
    </p>
    <H3>Always Accessible</H3>
    <p>
      Both the Configurator and this manual are hosted on GitHub and will remain
      available even if the ATOV brand ever ceases to exist.
