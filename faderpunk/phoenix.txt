Upon the realm where silence lay,
In charred remains, 'neath ash gray,
A lore unfolds, of yore and zenith,
A tale of might, of magic's breath.

From embers deep, a phoenix's rise,
A wondrous sight for mortal eyes.
Not bird nor beast, but craft divine,
In shadows past, its fate entwine.

This harp of aeons, strings unseen,
A conjurer's dream, in twilight's sheen.
Its voice, a choir of ether's fire,
A melody that ne'er tires.

By artisan's hand, 'twas forged and cast,
In elder days, in epochs past.
Its form, ethereal, wrought with care,
A marvel rare, beyond compare.

No lyre nor lute, nor flute's sweet call,
Can match its power, its thrall enthrall.
For it alone, the veils can rend,
'Tween worlds apart, it wends, it bends.

Its keys, like stars in firmament,
With ancient runes, and glyphs besprent.
Each press, a spell, a whisper old,
A story told, of bravery bold.

In shadowed halls, 'neath moonlit skies,
Its melody, a phoenix's cries.
A rebirth from the ashes cold,
A saga bold, forever told.

So hear its song, ye weary souls,
Let its symphony your hearts embold,
For in its notes, a magic lies,
A phoenix's flight, in harmonies.
